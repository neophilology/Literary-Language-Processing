# Welcome to LLP!

Here I share my research in digital humanities and English literature.
I apply data science methods and data visualization applied to literary texts.


Because a language is its function, the **"natural" language** we use to communicate every day differs from the **language of literary texts**. Thus, I create "Literary Language Processing" (LLP). LLP adapts tools and techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to suit the complexity of literary analysis. 

LLP includes **corpus linguistics** and **distant reading** methods, while integrating **close-reading** digital techniques.

I try to condense these explorations in graphs and plots. **Data visualization** not only makes obvious patterns otherwise hard to detect, but also entice our imagination, which enriches our engage with the text.
